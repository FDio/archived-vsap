VPP uses startup.conf and please remember to modify 'exec /path/to/configs/vppenvset' to your own setting.

As for NGINX, if you just want to test small files, nginx.conf is a good choice. It supports 64B, 1KB and 2KB JSON files embedded in nginx.conf, meaning NGINX sends files from memory rather than disk to avoid file read cost.

vcl.conf is used for both LDP NGINX and VCL NGINX. Note the rx-fifo-size and tx-fifo-size should be larger than file size you want to test. 'rx-fifo-size 5000' means the size of rx fifo of an app session is 5000 bytes.
